## Usage

To use Aether Chat, you'll need to provide your own Gemini API key in the `.env` file. The app handles the rest, creating a seamless conversational experience with one of the most advanced language models available.

## Privacy

Your API keys are never stored in the repository or shared. All conversations happen directly between your browser and Google's servers.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

This project is designed for educational and personal use to explore AI chat interfaces and Google's Gemini API capabilities.
